    		With the introduction of the Path of Legends, Leagues are moving away from the Trophy Road.So what will happen to your Trophies and your Profile Badges when the update goes live?
	
						
														    WHEN THE UPDATE DROPS

    		On October 26th (Update Day), we will perform a final reset of Trophies for all players in the current Leagues.This will be like a regular Season reset, so you will be able to collect rewards from 5000 Trophies and onwards again.But this time, instead of using your last Trophies count, we‚Äôll use your Highest Trophies count, and Trophies count after the reset will be capped at 6600 Trophies. You will keep all of your previous badges and achievements, but the current Season will not count. Meaning that if you‚Äôre the number 1 player in Leagues when the reset happens on Oct. 26th, this will not be taken into account, and you will not receive the ‚ÄúNumber 1‚Äù achievement/badge.This is because it is not a full Season.Your Highest Trophies and Best Season Rank (if you have one) will be displayed in the Player Profile‚Äôs new ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù section.The Path of Legends will then be immediately available to play with a full set of rewards, but the Season will be much shorter than usual (12 days).
	
						
														    WHEN THE FIRST FULL RANKED SEASON STARTS

    		On November 7th, the first full Ranked Season in the Path of Legends will start, and your Trophies will not reset.You will be able to continue your journey on Trophy Road!In the Path of Legends, all players will be placed in Challenger I and receive Win Multipliers depending on their ranking at the end of the Teaser Season. Top finishers will also receive the appropriate Badge upgrade according to their final rank in the Teaser Season.View more information about the Path of Legends and Win Multipliers in the Update Article here!

														    CARD LIST

    		Goblin Gang ‚òùÔ∏èElixir Golem ‚òùÔ∏èCannon üëáCannon Cart üëáRoyal Hogs üëáMighty Miner üëáMortar üëáBarbarian Hut üîÑRead all the changes and the reason for them below!
	
						
														
    		Spear Goblins count: ‚òùÔ∏è (2 -> 3)The greenest gang in the Arena has been relegated to a bottom-tier card for quite some time now. To help them regain their former glory, we‚Äôre bringing back the third Spear Goblin, who left the party five (!) years ago.
	
						
														
    		Attack speed: ‚òùÔ∏è (+15%, all forms)While we‚Äôre happy with its recent rework, the new elixir split left it a tiny bit underpowered. Increasing the Hit Speed of all three forms (Elixir Golem, Elixir Golemite, Elixir Blob) will make it more of a threat when he‚Äôs reached a Crown Tower.
	
						
														
    		Hitpoints: üëá (-8%)
	
						
														
    		Hitpoints (of destroyed form): üëá (-8%)
	
						
														
    		Cannon is currently one of the most popular buildings, thanks to its low elixir cost and good durability. We‚Äôre reducing its Hitpoints to make it more fragile and leave space for other defensive options.
This change will also affect the destroyed form of the Cannon Cart.
	
						
														
    		First Hit: üëá (-60% slower)Who let the Hogs out? These little piggies have proven to be quite powerful in the meta, most of the time requiring a perfect answer from the opponent so they don‚Äôt hit a Crown Tower. By delaying the first hit, defensive troops and Crown Towers will have a slightly larger window to destroy them.
	
						
														
    		Hitpoints: üëá (-8%)The Mighty Miner has finally ended up in a strong place in the Arena. He‚Äôs a bit too mighty, as it turns out. We trimmed his mustache, which instantly reduced his Hitpoints.
	
						
														
    		Hitpoints: üëá (-7%)
In the past few months, the Mortar has been gaining in popularity and strength thanks to new decks emerging with the Skeleton King. By reducing its Hitpoints, it will remain less time on the field and will be more easily destroyable.
	
						
														
    		Elixir Cost: üëá (7 -> 6) Spawn Speed: üëá (11sec -> 15sec)Spawn Count: ‚òùÔ∏è (2 -> 3)Lifetime: üëá (40sec -> 30sec)Spawn on Death: üëá (Barbarian x2 -> Barbarian x1)Total Barbarians spawned: üëá (10 -> 8)The cozy Barbarian Hut has been the worst card in the game for a long time. We‚Äôre talking Heal spell levels of bad!
While we think that a ‚Äúspawner meta‚Äù (Barb Hut, Goblin Hut, Furnace, Tombstone) makes the game more defensive and less fun, we also don‚Äôt want to leave this card in the depths of the Arena ‚Ä¶ and we definitely do not want to see a Barb Spirit!

This rework aims to encourage more aggressive plays with the Barbarian Hut by removing its defensive potential through various changes, while providing more value if it stays untouched.

    		Hey SML! Can you introduce yourself to the players? When did you start playing Clash Royale?Hello, my name is See-ming Lee, but most people know me by my initials SML. I am the founder of RoyaleAPI.
In my professional life, I am a User Experience (UX) Designer and Technologist. I have spent more than 25 years working at the intersection of art and technology in interactive media. I graduated from Yale in 1999, which gives you a clue about how old I am, not that age matters, of course. I currently reside in Hong Kong but have spent 17 years living in the US. I first picked up Clash Royale in 2016 while vacationing in Scotland, and the rest is history‚Ä¶

What is RoyaleAPI?
RoyaleAPI is a website that we have built to help players in countless ways, as well as enhance their Clash Royale experience. We have a variety of tools that are available to help everybody playing the game, from beginners to world-class professionals. 
New players generally use the simpler features like seeing their upcoming chests.
Intermediate players and CR veterans tend to explore deeper, using more advanced features like our Clan War tools, or keeping up to speed with coverage of game updates.
The professionals trust our esports database to log all the relevant achievements in their careers. Further to this, we have established ourselves as the top destination used in the competitive scene, and our services are essential for any professional players or analysts looking to succeed at any level, from semi-pro to the million-dollar Clash Royale League.

What would you say is the main purpose of RoyaleAPI? 
I see RoyaleAPI as the Swiss Army Knife of Clash Royale. Our aim is to provide any player, casual or pro, with the tools they need to play, learn and excel at the game. We specialize in finding great decks, perhaps the most critical aspect of Clash Royale. Our comprehensive range covers deck needs for Ladder as well as the variety of decks required to make special challenges as easy as possible. 
As with most card games, having a good deck is the basis for a winning strategy, and we can proudly say that many players trust RoyaleAPI to find it.


How did it start?Officially, the founding date of RoyaleAPI is July 28, 2017 ‚Äî this is the date when the first line of code was checked into our git repo. We are approaching our 5-year anniversary!
In the summer of 2017, we released a public API tool that enabled anyone to develop custom applications for the game. The largest project which came from the initial API was our flagship website: RoyaleAPI.com ‚Äî a proof-of-concept for data analysis. The website served as a means to encourage new projects and to demonstrate the capability of our API. Over time we‚Äôve developed an unmatched database of analytical data to support the casual and competitive community.

Eventually, Supercell released an official API, and although this made our API service redundant, our site was still useful to many players. We realized we could keep working on it to create features that no one else was capable of developing, and we‚Äôve kept doing that ever since.

How many people are working on RoyaleAPI? 
Our team is made up of two core members and a huge roster of volunteers. I am the only person who works full-time on the project. Alpe123 (Alvaro Pe√±a), our Director of Esports, spends about 20 hours per week on the site. Other members of the core team participate in important discussions and brainstorming sessions. We also work with several data scientists on data-intensive projects, and a huge team of translators who help put our site into 14 different languages.

What‚Äôs your favorite feature or part of RoyaleAPI? 
I am most proud of the monthly balance changes infographic which I first started creating for the entire community a few years ago. Prior to us starting the trend of a single image summary, many creators had demonstrated balance changes using before/after animation. While those videos are useful on the micro-level, I find that the macro view is often missing. The popularity of this single image can be seen by the thousands of upvotes it receives on social media, as well as a plethora of shares. 
I have also commenced making short videos each month about the upcoming seasons. Although videos are not traditionally part of our main content channels, I have worked my passion for animation into the mix to create a condensed video, usually under two minutes, to give a bird‚Äôs eye view of the upcoming season. 

In terms of functional features in RoyaleAPI, I‚Äôm most proud of being able to create several unique features which nobody else provides:

Real-time deck search with an exhaustive list of options, card filters, and game modes.
Matchup - a tool that shows the likelihood of a deck to succeed against other decks.
Replay - a timeline view of the game which shows detailed statistics about the game and gives a post-game analysis.
	
						
														
    		Any cool or fun facts that you can share?I can often tell if a pro player is playing in an important esports event without knowing about it in advance.

When that happens, real-time page views of their battle logs will always spike. It‚Äôs also easy to see when a special deck challenge is happening because so many people will search decks for those events. For example, most recently I was alerted of an ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù where deck searches for ‚ÄúThe Floor is Healing‚Äù were 332,540% more than predicted. As most people have learned, I‚Äôm a bit of a nerd, so this kind of data is my idea of fun‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs your favorite moment in CR history?
When Clash Royale switched to simplified levels.

Looking back, it must have been challenging for newcomers to grasp the concept of 9/7/4/1. If you look at old videos of Clash Royale, I‚Äôm still surprised how we managed to understand that max levels were: 13 common, 11 rare, 8 epic, 5 legendary. It seems second nature now, but it was quite frankly demanding on the brain. Well, my brain anyway, so I really appreciated that change.

Can you share/tease any new features you are working on?
There are a couple of high-level features that we are working on right now, which we hope to release soon.

Duel search - This is somewhat challenging because the duel set combinations are not easily composed, and we have decided that it likely won‚Äôt give any meaningful results if we grab 4 actual decks that people use ‚Äî the probability of players using the exact 4 decks for war is so low that it would not be statistically meaningful. Rather, we are using some fairly advanced methodology to compose duel sets based on decks‚Äô win rates and use rates. Doing this allows us to find high-performing decks without anyone actually having played the exact set before.

Badge Leaderboard - In addition to the in-game badges, we have implemented many custom badges for players. Noting that players are extra motivated by ranks and bragging rights, we plan to turn most of these custom achievements into full leaderboards.

What is your creator code?
Our creator code is RoyaleAPI ‚Äî btw, you can type all the letters in lower case if you like!

CARD LIST

Mother Witch ‚òùÔ∏èElectro Giant ‚òùÔ∏è Night Witch ‚òùÔ∏èBarbarians ‚òùÔ∏èGoblin Drill üëá
Skeleton King üëáThe Log üëáRoyal Ghost üëáBarbarian Barrel üîÑRead all the changes and the reason for them below!

	
						
														
    		Hit Speed: ‚òùÔ∏è (+9% faster) First Hit: ‚òùÔ∏è (+25% faster) The last balance change caused her use and win rates to plummet. This buff counters the previous Hitpoints nerf with a DPS increase, allowing her to churn out those Cursed Hogs even faster!
	
						
														
    		Hitpoints: ‚òùÔ∏è (+9%)The latest rework made him a bit too fragile, even with a lower Elixir cost. Adding more Hitpoints allows him to still keep the title of ‚ÄòGiant‚Äô.
Note - this change is roughly halfway between its old 8 Elixir Hitpoint values and his current.
	
						
														
    		Hit Speed: ‚òùÔ∏è (+13% faster)Since the removal of her Death Spawn Bats, she struggles to find her place in a meta. We are increasing her very slow Hit Speed to emphasize her role as a dual support/Damage dealer.
	
						
														
    		Hit Speed: ‚òùÔ∏è (7% faster)(affects Barbarians, Battle Ram, Barbarian Hut, Barbarian Barrel)
The above-mentioned cards have all been on the weaker side for a while, however, the Barb Barrel has been solid. Now with the Barrel range nerf (see at the bottom) there‚Äôs an opportunity to buff all 4 Barbarian cards in the game and hopefully bring their use/win rate up a bit!
	
						
														
    		Travel Speed: üëá (25% slower)Apparently all the extra tunnels the Mighty Miner has been digging have been allowing the Drill to travel faster than usual! Fresh soil has been packed into the Arena to slow those Goblins down.(Translation: A recent change to the Mighty Miner‚Äôs mechanic had a knock-on effect, and turned out to accidentally increase the Goblin Drill‚Äôs speed. This has now been fixed.)
	
						
														
    		Soul Summoning Ability: üëá (Max. Skeleton count 20 -> 18)The undisputed King of Bones has become a Champion that puts too much pressure on the opponent when he has collected enough souls. We‚Äôve asked him to chill out on the whole ‚Äòsummon endless hordes of the undead‚Äô thing he has going on.
	
						
														
    		Damage dealt to Crown Towers: üëá 30% -> 20% (-33%)This piece of sentient wood has been the most used card in the game for a long time because of its versatility and power. The time has come for it to receive a nerf!Thanks to player feedback, we decided to keep its knockback ability as it was but reduced its Crown Tower Damage. This means that it still keeps its Legendary knockback status whilst still being able to defeat log bait. The trade-off is that it won‚Äôt be able to deal as much Crown Tower Damage as other spells.
	
						
														
    		Invisibility cooldown: üëá (1.6s -> 1.8s)This sleepy fella is a part of many strong meta decks and can provide a lot of value. Maybe a little too much. Allowing him to be visible for a little while longer can help to balance this.
	
						
														
    		Range: üëá (5 -> 4.5)Alongside The Log, Barb Barrel has been one of the strongest cards in the game consistently for many months. The Range reduction will allow the Barbarian to only hit the tower once instead of twice if unanswered.
